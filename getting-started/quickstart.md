# Quick Start: Your First Kaspa Application

Get started with Kaspa development by choosing your preferred language and approach. This guide provides multiple pathways to build your first Kaspa application.

## Choose Your Path

Kaspa supports development in multiple languages. Pick the one you're most comfortable with:

- **[JavaScript/TypeScript](#javascript-quickstart)** - Web and Node.js applications
- **[Rust](#rust-quickstart)** - High-performance native applications

---

## JavaScript Quickstart

Best for: Web applications, Node.js backends, rapid prototyping

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- Basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- A Kaspa wallet (see "Get a Wallet" section above)

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Use the Kaspa starter CLI to quickly set up a new project:

```bash
npx @kluster/kaspa-starter-cli
```

This will:
- Create a new Kaspa project with best practices
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up example code to get you started

Follow the prompts to configure your project (name, template, etc.).

### Step 2: Get Testnet KAS

Get a wallet address from your wallet (Kasware, Kastle, Kaspium, etc.), then visit the testnet faucet:
- **[https://faucet-tn10.kaspanet.io/](https://faucet-tn10.kaspanet.io/)**
- Paste your wallet address to receive free testnet tokens


## Rust Quickstart

Best for: High-performance applications, system tools, native integrations

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ installed ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- Basic Rust knowledge
